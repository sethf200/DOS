# DOS

This is a very simple Denial Of Service Python script that creates thousands of HTTP requests per second. Enter IP address or URL and you're set.

The script most likely won't do any damage to any sites whatsoever given the bandwidth and computing power availible to todays sites and services.

It is purely for testing and education purposes. Have fun.
